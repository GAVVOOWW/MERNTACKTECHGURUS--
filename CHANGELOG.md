## [2025-06-28] - Customized Products Payment System Implementation

### 📋 **OrderDetail.jsx Updates**

#### **Added Functions:**
1. **`hasCustomizedItems(order)`**
   - **Purpose**: Check if order contains any customized products
   - **Logic**: Iterate through order items and check `is_customizable` flag
   - **Console Logs**: Item checking process and result

2. **`calculatePaymentAmounts(order)`**
   - **Purpose**: Calculate payment amounts for mixed cart (customized + normal items)
   - **Logic**: 
     - Down payment = (customized total × 30%) + normal items total
     - Remaining balance = customized total × 70%
   - **Console Logs**: Item categorization, totals, and final calculations

3. **`getPaymentStatus(order)` - Enhanced**
   - **Purpose**: Determine payment status based on item types
   - **Logic**: 
     - Customized orders: Use down payment thresholds
     - Normal orders: Simple full payment check
   - **Console Logs**: Payment calculations and status determination

4. **`getRemainingBalance(order)` - Enhanced**
   - **Purpose**: Calculate accurate remaining balance
   - **Logic**: For customized orders, only 70% of customized items count as remaining
   - **Console Logs**: Balance calculations

#### **UI Changes:**
- **Camera Icon**: Added beside customized products in order items table
- **Payment Display**: Enhanced to show down payment vs full payment status
- **Pay Full Button**: Added for customized orders with remaining balance

---

### 🔧 **Payment Logic Rules**

#### **For Mixed Cart:**
```
Down Payment = (Customized Items Total × 0.3) + Normal Items Total
Remaining Balance = Customized Items Total × 0.7
Full Total = Customized Items Total + Normal Items Total
```

#### **Payment Status Logic:**
- **Fully Paid**: Paid amount ≥ 99% of total (allows rounding differences)
- **Downpaid**: Paid amount ≥ down payment amount (for customized orders)
- **Partial Payment**: Some payment made but below thresholds
- **Unpaid**: No payment made

2. 🔄 Add camera icon to customized products (IN PROGRESS)
